# flore1-paint
An ascii color paint/animation software for the terminal.

Disclaimer: It was originaly made for fun in one afternoon. My code for this looks rubbish to me.

# How to use it ?

C:\flore1-paint\> py main.py
```
Press TAB to see the manual.
In theory its pretty much cross-platform according you have root access on unix.
